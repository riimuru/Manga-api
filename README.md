            {...},
            ...
        ]
    }
]
```

#### Example 2:

This query will exclude slice of life and sports genre and filter by a completed manga and the manga title `one piece`.

Example:

```
curl 'http://localhost:3000/manga_list?sts=completed&keyw=one%20piece'
```

Response body:

```json
[
    {
        "info": {
            "keyword": "one piece",
            "filter_status": "completed",
            "included_genres": "",
            "excluded_genres": "",
            "order_by": "",
            "current_page": 1,
            "totalPages": ""
        },
        "data": []
    }
]
```

response is empty because one piece is not completed yet :).

### GET /manga_info

#### Example 1:

"id" parameter and "host-name" header can be found in `GET /manga_list` response body as seen in the above sample.

Example:

```
curl --header "host-name: readmanganato.com" http://localhost:3000/manga_info?id=manga-cb980036
```

Response body:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "The World Of Otome Games Is Tough For Mobs",
        "img": "https://avt.mkklcdnv6temp.com/13/q/17-1583495755.jpg",
        "alt": "Otome Game Sekai wa Mob ni Kibishii Sekai Desu",
        "authors": [
            {
                "authorName": "Yomu Mishima",
                "authorLink": "https://manganato.com/author/story/eW9tdV9taXNoaW1h"
            },
            {...},
            ...
        ],
        "status": "Ongoing",
        "lastUpdated": "Dec 04,2021 - 07:21 AM",
        "views": "20,764,407",
        "synopsis": "Leon, a former Japanese worker, was reincarnated into an ...",
        "rating": "4.8",
        "totalVotes": "8688",
        "genres": [
            {
                "genre": "Adventure",
                "genreLink": "https://manganato.com/genre-4"
            },
            {
                "genre": "Comedy",
                "genreLink": "https://manganato.com/genre-6"
            },
            {...},
            ...
        ],
        "chapters": [
            {
                "chapterTitle": "Chapter 38",
                "chapterViews": "30,031",
                "uploadedDate": "2 hour ago ",
                "chapterLink": "https://readmanganato.com/manga-cb980036/chapter-38"
            },
            {...},
            ...
        ]
    }
]
```

or you can use the `url` header instead like the below example to achieve the same result.

#### Example 2:

Example:

```command
curl --header "url: https://readmanganato.com/manga-cb980036" http://localhost:3000/manga_info
```

Resbonse body:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "The World Of Otome Games Is Tough For Mobs",
        "img": "https://avt.mkklcdnv6temp.com/13/q/17-1583495755.jpg",
        "alt": "Otome Game Sekai wa Mob ni Kibishii Sekai Desu",
        "authors": [
            {
                "authorName": "Yomu Mishima",
                "authorLink": "https://manganato.com/author/story/eW9tdV9taXNoaW1h"
            },
            {...},
            ...
        ],
        "status": "Ongoing",
        "lastUpdated": "Dec 04,2021 - 07:21 AM",
        ...
        "genres": [
            {
                "genre": "Adventure",
                "genreLink": "https://manganato.com/genre-4"
            },
            {...},
            ...
        ],
        "chapters": [
            {
                "chapterTitle": "Chapter 38",
                "chapterViews": "30,031",
                "uploadedDate": "2 hour ago ",
                "chapterLink": "https://readmanganato.com/manga-cb980036/chapter-38"
            },
            {...},
            ...
```

### GET /read_manga

Finally, as seen in the sample below, you will be able to receive chapter pages as jpg images.

#### Example 1:

`url` header can be seen in the example above.

Example:

```command
curl --header "url: https://readmanganato.com/manga-cb980036/chapter-38" http://localhost:3000/read_manga
```

Response body:

```json
[
    {
        "img": "https://s8.mkklcdnv6temp.com/mangakakalot/v1/vk917567/chapter_38/1.jpg",
        "pageTitle": "The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Chapter 38 page 1"
    },
    {
        "img": "https://s8.mkklcdnv6temp.com/mangakakalot/v1/vk917567/chapter_38/2.jpg",
        "pageTitle": "The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Chapter 38 page 2"
    },
    {
        "img": "https://s8.mkklcdnv6temp.com/mangakakalot/v1/vk917567/chapter_38/3.jpg",
        "pageTitle": "The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs Chapter 38 page 3"
    },
    {...},
    ...
]
```
